# smart_home

A project designed to make home automation and smart control accessible, integrating sensors, actuators, and digital routines for a smarter living environment.

## ** Overview **
Goal: Simplify digital control over home appliances and environmental monitoring.

## **Core Functions**

Sensor integration (temperature, line detection, microphones).

Actuator controls (servos, fans, etc.).

Implements logic for automatic response to sensor data.

## **Requirements**
Software:

Libraries: SoftwareSerial.h, Servo.h, DHT.h

Hardware:

Servo Motor, Temperature Sensor, Fan, Line Detector, Microphone

## **How To Run**
Install libraries and assemble hardware as per the requirements.

Upload code through Arduino IDE with required libraries installed.

Test each module separately, then operate the integrated system.

## **Credits**
Developed by Moataz and teammate Muhammed Ismail at Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University.
